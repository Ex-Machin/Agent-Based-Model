Overview

This project is a demo for agent based modelling. I tried to implement here a simulation of houseowners looking for a new heating system. Futher it can be extended to test behavioural theories or practice plotting of the large datasets. 

Run Simulation
```
python main.py
```

Run Tests
```
python TestHeatingSystemSelection.py
